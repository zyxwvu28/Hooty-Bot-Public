# HootyBot Reply Suggestions Update

The purpose of this document is to provide an update on all suggestions provided by the [HootyBot Reply Suggestions form](https://forms.gle/67fM5hwX78DHaf6s6).
If your suggestion isn't on this list, it means I haven't seen it yet. I need to manually update this list, so check back later. If you have questions about my decision, pm me on Reddit @ [u/zyxwvu28](https://www.reddit.com/user/zyxwvu28/) (Note, you will no longer remain anonymous to me)

| No (only on replies to his "wanna hear MY worst nightmare" posts) | :( | :x: At the moment, Hooty is incapable of carrying out conversations. When I implement that feature, I'll consider adding this. |

| Hooty | Did someone call me? Man have I got a story to tell you! So like this one time I ate a bug and then this other bug blah blah blah blah blah-And thats how I ate two bugs in one second! | :x: I like this quote, but the keyword is used way too commonly on the subreddit that the bot would spam this quote all the time. If I can think of a better keyword, I'll add it. But if you think of one before I do, feel free to resubmit this quote through the [replies suggestion form](https://forms.gle/XaArBT9fcXX4RgxJ6) again. |
| house | Is the room spinning or is it just me? Ah. Just a little house humor. | :white_check_mark: See index [63](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv) |
| We all know someone is bout to die | Hoot hooty will kill | :x: This can easily be taken out of context, so out of caution, I've excluded this suggestion |
| Have you heard of the hit game among us? | That's a bit suspicious, Hoot. | :white_check_mark: See index [64](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv) |
| 'hooty' AND ('eat' OR 'hope') | I am inevitable, hoot! | :white_check_mark: See index [65](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv). Ok, I know this is a Thanos reference, but I don't understand why the given keywords should trigger the given response. HOWEVER, since you're the first person to correctly provide me the requested boolean syntax for my advanced queries, I've decided to allow this. (Though, you forgot the '& q:' and didn't parse the exception words properly either so I interpreted that as OR) |
| Hooting | Hoot hoot! | :white_check_mark: See index [66](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv) |

| \*\*\*\* | DON'T SAY NONO WORDS! HOOT HOOT! | :x: I get that this is supposed to be a swear word, but the way this is written and knowing how my bot works, I don't think it's funny enough. |
| cult | I HAVE A CULT HOOOT HOOT! r/CultOfHooty | :white_check_mark: See index [71](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv) |

| Hoot, I'm a big boy house, I am your god | HOOT, GAHOOT | :white_check_mark: I added this, but you should know that this will probably never get triggered unless someone somehow types out that exact sentence, including the commas in the right place. PM me on Reddit if you want to increase the chances of this reply being triggered naturally. See index [75](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv) |
| Hoot | Here a hoot, there a hoot, somewhere else a hoot hoot, hooty-hoot hoot! | :white_check_mark: See index [76](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv) |

## Common reasons for rejection

| Reason   | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Keyword too common | I don't want HootyBot to spam the subreddit too often, so if your keyword is a word that's commonly used on the subreddit, I'm unlikely to add it. Exceptions are granted to jokes that I think are extremely good |
| :heavy_check_mark: Already added something similar | SPOILER ALERT ❗ To see a full list of all keyword-reply pairs, go to [HootyBotResponseDF.csv](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv). I have added the index number of something similiar I alread added. If you think that your suggestion is sufficiently distinct from the one I added, you can [discuss that here](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/discussions/categories/hootybot-reply-suggestions)|
| Hooty can't do conversations yet | At the moment, Hooty can only make one-sided conversations. It cannot properly respond to someone that has responded to HootyBot (although sometimes it does that by coincidence). I plan on adding that feature though, and when I do, I'll consider adding these past suggestions. |
