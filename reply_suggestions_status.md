The purpose of this document is to provide an update on all suggestions provided by the [HootyBot Reply Suggestions form](https://forms.gle/67fM5hwX78DHaf6s6).

# Common reasons for rejection:
| Reason   | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Keyword too common | I don't want HootyBot to spam the subreddit too often, so if your keyword is a word that's commonly used on the subreddit, I'm unlikely to add it. Exceptions are granted to jokes that I think are extremely good |
