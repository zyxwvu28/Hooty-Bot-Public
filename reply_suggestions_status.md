# HootyBot Reply Suggestions Update

The purpose of this document is to provide an update on all suggestions provided by the [HootyBot Reply Suggestions form](https://forms.gle/67fM5hwX78DHaf6s6). 
If your suggestion isn't on this list, it means I haven't seen it yet. I need to manually update this list, so check back later. If you have questions about my decision, pm me on Reddit @ [u/zyxwvu28](https://www.reddit.com/user/zyxwvu28/) (Note, you will no longer remain anonymous to me)

# Common reasons for rejection:
| Reason   | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Keyword too common | I don't want HootyBot to spam the subreddit too often, so if your keyword is a word that's commonly used on the subreddit, I'm unlikely to add it. Exceptions are granted to jokes that I think are extremely good |
| :heavy_check_mark: Already added something similar | SPOILER ALERT ‚ùó To see a full list of all keyword-reply pairs, go to [HootyBotResponseDF.csv](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/blob/main/ReplyDFs/HootyBotResponseDF.csv). If you think that your suggestion is sufficiently distinct from the one I added, you can [discuss that here](https://github.com/zyxwvu28/Hooty-Bot-Public/discussions/categories/hootybot-reply-suggestions)|
| Hooty can't do conversations yet | At the moment, Hooty can only make one-sided conversations. It cannot properly respond to someone that has responded to HootyBot (although sometimes it does that by coincidence). I plan on adding that feature though, and when I do, I'll consider adding these past suggestions. |
